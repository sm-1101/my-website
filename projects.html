                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <p>My first actual project was in my Programming Fundamentals II with professor Mark C, Usnick at Amarillo College in Texas. The project involved a set of programs
                        that would read in assembly code, compile the assembly code, then finally run it on its own RunTimeEnvironment. All of this ofcourse was done with JAVA and the 
                        background environment was through BASH.
