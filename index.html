                    <h3>Project 1 (VPCrte project)</h3>
                    <p>My first significant project took place in Programming Fundamentals II 
                       with Professor Mark C. Usnick, Amarillo College, Texas. The project 
                       comprised a suite of programs designed to read, compile, and execute assembly 
                       code using a custom Runtime Environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first program, <strong>Assemble.java</strong>, is responsible for reading 
                        assembly code from the <strong>averageNums.asm</strong> file and converting it 
                        into code that the RuntimeEnvironment can read.
                    </p>

                    <img src = "assemble2.png">
                    <p>The second program, <strong>VPCrte.java</strong>, is designed to decipher the 
                        code and execute various commands. Although its implementation is quite
                        basic, it effectively illustrates the underlying processes that occur within a 
                        computer as users navigate different browsers and environments.
                    </p>
                    <img src = "VPCrte.png">
                    <img src = "VPCrte2.png">
                    <img src = "VPCrte3.png">
                    <p>The final program is the assembly code itself, labeled <strong>averageNums.asm</strong>,
                        which calculates the average of all numbers entered via the command line. An intriguing 
                        aspect of this program is that it utilizes only one General Purpose Register (GPREG), which 
                        adds a layer of complexity to finding the solution. We temporarily store unused numbers in random 
                        memory locations and retrieve them into the GPREG when needed to perform the calculations.
                    </p>
                    <img src = "averageNums.png">
                    <p>With all the programs presented, the next step is to run the assembly code through the 
                        <strong>Assemble.java</strong> file using the following command: <code>java Assemble 
                        averageNums.asm</code>.
                    </p>
                    <img src = "averageNumsexe2.png">
                    <p>Once executed, the output file named <strong>averageNums.exe</strong> can be utilized within 
                        the Virtual PC runtime environment to calculate the average of the input numbers.
                    </p>
                    <img src = "averageNumsexecution.png">
                    <p>Finally, the code includes a debug option that provides a visual representation of the internal 
                        processes, allowing users to see how the computer interprets the information and executes its tasks.
