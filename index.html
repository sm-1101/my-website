                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                    <p>My first actual project was in my Programming Fundamentals II with professor Mark C, Usnick at Amarillo College in Texas. The project involved a set of programs
                        that would read in assembly code, compile the assembly code, then finally run it on its own RunTimeEnvironment. All of this ofcourse was done with JAVA and the 
                        background environment was through BASH.
                    </p>
                    <img src = "assemble1.png">
                    <img src = "assemble2.png">
                    <p> This first program is labeled as Assemble.java and is used
                        to read in the assembly code through the averageNums.asm file
                        and in doing so will convert it to machine code.
                    </p>
                    <img src = "VPCrte.png">
                    <img src = "VPCrte2.png">
                    <img src = "VPCrte3.png">
                    <p> This second program is labeled as VPCrte.java will ultimately
                        decipher the machine code itself and utilize the different 
                        commands which is very barebones but nonetheless shows what
                        everyone's computer is doing as you navigate to different browsers
                        and environments.
                    </p>
                    <img src = "averageNums.png">
                    <p>The last program is the Assembly code itself labeled as 
                        averageNums.asm which takes the average of all the numbers entered
                        into the command line. What makes this program interesting is we
                        only utilized one GPREG which made finding the solution interesting.
                        We would dump the unused numbers at the time into random memory locations
                        and when needed pull the numbers into the GPREG to perform the actual
                        calculations on.
                    </p>
                    <img src = "averageNumsexe2.png">
                    <p> With all the programs now shown, the first step is to run the assembly
                        code into the Assemble.java file by using these commands: java Assemble averageNums.asm 
                    </p>
                    <img src = "averageNumsexecution.png">
                    <p>  Now the output file labeled as averageNums.exe can be utilized in the 
                        Virtual PC runtime environment to calculate the average of numbers.
                    </p>
                    <img src = "actualdebug1.png">
                    <img src = "actualdebug2.png">
                    <p> Finally there is a debug option implemented in the code that will
                        give a visual representation of what is going on behind the 
                        scenes as the computer reads the information and performs its tasks.
